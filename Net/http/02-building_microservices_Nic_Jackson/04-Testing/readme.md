# Introduction of testing
When you try to define what testing is, you will come up with a multitude of answers, and many of us will not understand the full benefits of testing until we've been burnt by buggy software or we have tried to change a complex code base which has no tests.
>"The art of a good night's sleep is knowing you will not get woken by a support call and the piece of mind from being able to
confidently change your software in an always moving market."

OK, so I am trying to be funny, but the concept is correct:
* Nobody enjoys debugging poorly written code, and indeed,
* Nobody enjoys the stress caused when a system fails.
* Starting out with a mantra of quality first can alleviate many of these problems.
